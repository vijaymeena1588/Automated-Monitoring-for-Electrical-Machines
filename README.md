## üõ†Ô∏è My Role and Contributions

My focus was on the **hardware-software interface** and **control logic**. I was responsible for:

- **Developing the Arduino Sketch:** I wrote the microcontroller code to accurately read from the voltage and current sensors, perform necessary calculations, and format the data for serial transmission.
- **Designing the Python GUI:** I built the desktop application to handle serial communication, parse incoming data, and present it in a clear, interactive format.
- **Ensuring System Robustness:** I implemented multi-threading to prevent the GUI from freezing during data acquisition and added error handling to manage serial communication failures.
- **Data Handling:** I created the functionality to store, plot, and display the collected data, providing users with a complete view of the experiment's results.
